# Fundamental Metadata Attributes

This directory contains all of the fundamental metadata attributes that can be specified of elements. As a proof-of-concept, these attributes are themselves defined via the SimpleSchema definition language.

Plugins can specify additional metadata attributes for elements:

- of different types (Item vs. Structure)
- at different levels within an element hierarchy (top-level vs. nested)
- based on cardinality
